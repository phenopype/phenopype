# phenopype: a phenotyping pipeline for python

<img src="assets/figures/header.png">

<div align="justify">

Phenopype is a high throughput phenotyping pipeline for Python. It aims at supporting biologists in their efforts to extract high dimensional phenotypic data from digital images. Phenopype provides high level functions for image processing that can be stacked and executed sequentially to efficiently process single images or large data sets in a semi or fully automated fashion. Users can assemble their own function-stacks that can be customized and stored along with raw data for full reproducibility (check the high throughput workflow). Phenopype can be run from a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE), like <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a>. Some python knowledge is necessary, but most of the heavy lifting is done in the background. Penopype can be installed from the Python Package Index (PYPI) using <code>pip install phenopype</code>. To get started, <a href="https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype/archive/master.zip">clone the Github-repo</a> and <a href="tutorial_0.html">run the tutorials</a>.

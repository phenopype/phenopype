Unreleased 
==========

- histogram adjustment via colour scale
- change rectangle method for mask_maker
- add testing: tracking, landmark, mask, 
- add tutorial: tracking
- project management globally acessible through base functions
- a quick-thresholding method in marked area for single images 
- object_finder returns histogram of length, area and grayscale of all objects

midterm:
- declutter modules / remove self. references

longterm:
- internal: decluttering of base module / outhousing of classes and methods 
- watershed algorithms

Known bugs
==========
- high GUI / windows sometimes crash. Stop Kernel and use "cv2.destroyAllWindows()"


0.9.0
------
- show_img can now show multiple images when list is provided


0.8.0
------
- scale_maker is completely reworked: now has zoom and onscreen notifications for mm/pixel info. measuring scale and making a template for detection are now two separate functions (measure_scale and make_scale_template)
- documentation and API reference for tracking module added 
- test for scale added

0.7.2
------
- landmark_maker has now (limited) mousewheel zooming functionality, future releases will provide full gapless zooming
- changed instructions for phenopype installation: make virtual env in conda for better package control (e.g. avoid different opencv versions)

0.7.1
------
bugfix:
- "filename not found" when no objects were found

0.7.0
------
- full landmark functionality added (refer to "landmark_maker" readme in the docs)
- additionally: measure length of curvy specimens from within the landmarking function ("arc")
- generic image registration (aka feature recognition) added, will be properly introduced and documented in the next version 


0.6.1
------
- "scale_maker" can return now has attribute "mask_obj" to pass on to "object_finder" (tuple of 3)
bugfix:
- missing "filetypes" argument in "project_finder" help
- default value for "factor in "scale.detect"


0.6.0
------
- integration with opencv-contrib-python==3.4.5.20
- tracking functionality added, integration with trackpy
- testing environment in place, integration with pytest
- initialize classes directly with image
- tutorials included for basic python (1) and object finding (2)
Known bugs:
- base "fillyPoly" sometimes breaks - culprit numpy datatype?
- base.polygon_maker "include=False" excludes everything


0.5.1
------
- functions take numpy array in addition to string with path to image
- bugfix: opencv-contrib-python version 3.* 


0.5.0
------
- object_finder functions streamlined and "skeletonize" algorithm added
- better documentation with docstrings 
- docstring integration with sphinx 
- __init__ rework for sphinx integration

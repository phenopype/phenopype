Choosing a text editor
-------------------------

Phenopype's high throughout workflow currently requires a text editor to be installed that does not lock the file (`read about file locking here <https://superuser.com/a/855057/970488>`_).

.. attention::

	Your OS needs to know how to handle `.yaml` files. Make sure that the default app to open these files is set. Otherwise, phenopype will be unable to open YAML configuration files (this is a common error source).


For Windows, `Notepad` works. However, I highly recommend `Notepad++`, which supports syntax highlighting and has many other useful features: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/. Check this SO post to deactivate refresh-popups: https://superuser.com/a/34553/970488

Pype class
----------

phenopype's core method to process image datasets with high throughput and reproducibility. Should be used in conjunction with images organized in a Phenopype directory structure. The ``Pype`` class has specific implicit behavior that aims at supporting speed and robustness when working in "production" (i.e., when performing the actual analysis of large image datasets compared to prototyping and low throughput workflow). These are the most important things to keep in mind during a ``Pype`` iteration:

    **Enhanced Window control**

    In addition to regular window control functions documented in `Tutorial 2 <tutorial_2.ipynb#Window-control>`__:

    - Editing and saving the opened configuration file in the text editor will trigger another iteration, i.e., close the image window and run the config file again.
    - Closing the image window manually (with the X button in the upper right) also triggers another run.
    - ``Esc`` will close all windows and interrupt the pype routine (triggers ``sys.exit()``, which will also end a Python session if run from the command line), as well as any loops.
    - Each step that requires user interaction (e.g., ``create_mask`` or ``landmarks``) needs to be confirmed with ``Enter`` until the next function in the sequence is executed.
    - At the end of the analysis, when the final steps (visualization and export functions) have run, use ``Ctrl+Enter`` to finish and close the window.

    **Function execution**

    - ``Pype`` will automatically load the image and execute all functions in sequence, but it will not overwrite data from past iterations on disk unless specified.
    - To overwrite interactive user input, set the argument ``edit: true`` or ``edit: overwrite`` in the function’s annotation control arguments.
    - If you forget to remove an overwrite argument and are prompted to overwrite previous input, immediately change to ``edit: false`` argument, and save the config file.
    - If a ``Pype`` is initialized on a project directory, it will attempt to load input data (e.g., masks) that contain the provided ``tag`` argument. For example, ``pp.Pype(path, tag="v1")`` will attempt to load any files in the directory that contain the suffix ``"v1"`` (e.g., ``"annotations_v1.json"``).

    **Visualizing the results**

    Aspects of visual feedback during a ``pype`` run (can be completely suppressed by setting ``visualize=False``):

    - Visual feedback (i.e., output from ``landmarks``, ``detect_contours`` or ``create_mask``) are drawn onto a “canvas” (a copy of the original image).
    - Use ``select_canvas`` to draw the results either on the raw image, a binary image, or a single color channel (gray, red, green or blue).
    - If ``select_canvas`` is not explicitly specified, it is called automatically and defaults to the raw image as canvas.
    - Output from all functions needs to be specified manually. For example, after using ``- landmarks``, ``- draw_landmarks`` should be called in the ``visualization`` module.
    - Visual parameters of interactive tools (e.g., ``point_size`` or ``line_thickness``) are specified separately in the respective function and in the ``visualization`` module.

    **Exporting the results**

    Saving annotations, canvas, and other results:

    - All results are saved automatically, even if the respective functions in ``export`` are not specified, with the ``tag`` argument in ``Pype`` as suffix.
    - If a file already exists in the directory, and the respective function is *not* listed under ``export``, then it *will not* be overwritten.
    - If an export function *is* specified under ``export:``, it *will also not overwrite* any existing file, unless specified using ``overwrite: true``.
    - The canvas is an exception: it will always be saved and always be overwritten (unless specified with ``overwrite: False``) to show the output from the last iteration. However, users can modify the canvas name with ``file_name`` in the arguments to save different output side by side. For example, ``file_name: binary`` under ``- save_canvas:`` saves the canvas as ``canvas_binary.jpg``.

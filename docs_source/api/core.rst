Core modules
------------

Core image processing functions. Any function can be executed in manual mode (python code) or interactive mode (yaml files). In general, the typical order in which the different steps are performed is something like:

**preprocessing > segmentation > measurement > visualization > export**

However, since phenopype version 2 **you can arrange them however you like**.
